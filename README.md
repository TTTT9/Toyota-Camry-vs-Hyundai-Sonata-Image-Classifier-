# 🚗 Toyota Camry vs Hyundai Sonata - Image Classifier 🔍

This project is an image classification model trained to distinguish between **Toyota Camry** and **Hyundai Sonata** vehicles using a deep learning approach in Google Colab.

The model was built, trained, and tested using TensorFlow and Keras. It was later exported and evaluated using real test images.

## 📁 Project Overview

- **Model Type:** Image Classification (Binary Classifier)
- **Frameworks Used:** TensorFlow, Keras
- **Platform:** Google Colab
- **Classes:**  
  - `Toyota Camry`  
  - `Hyundai Sonata`

## 🧠 How It Works

- A dataset of labeled images of both vehicle types was used.
- The model was trained using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
- After training, the model was tested on new unseen images to evaluate accuracy.
- The model can now predict if an input image is a Camry or Sonata.
